Man in The Lock

This is the source code for the Arduino "Teensyduino" used in the DEF CON 29 talk "No Key? No Pin? No Combo? No Problem!" by Roy Davis.

Essentially, if you saw the talk that was given in person at DEF CON (not the pre-recorded version), and know what you are doing with an Arduino, you should be able to figure out what to do with this.
